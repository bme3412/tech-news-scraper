    "summary": "President Donald Trump suggested he may reduce tariffs on China to assist in closing a deal for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations. Trump emphasized China's role in approving the divestiture and hinted at potential tariff reductions to facilitate the process, noting the significance of tariffs over the value of TikTok. The deadline for the TikTok deal was extended to April 5, and Trump aims for the U.S. to maintain a 50% ownership in TikTok through a joint venture. Despite potential deadline extensions, Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence in reaching a TikTok-related deal by the deadline.",
