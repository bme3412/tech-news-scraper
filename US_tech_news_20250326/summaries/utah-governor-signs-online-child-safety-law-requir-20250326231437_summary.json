    "summary": "Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed a bill requiring Apple and Google's app stores to verify user ages and obtain parental permission for those under 18 to use certain apps. This law aims to protect children by shifting the responsibility of age verification to app stores. Apple and Google will have to implement age checks for new accounts and link underage accounts to parents. Industry reactions are mixed, with Meta, X, and Snap supporting the bill while Google raises privacy concerns. The law is set to take effect on May 7 and may face legal challenges.",
