    "summary": "OpenAI's new GPT-4o feature allows users to create Studio Ghibli-style images from various sources using an \"omni\" model trained on text, code, imagery, and potentially other media forms. The update has led to a surge in users sharing anime-style images of famous figures and scenes. However, the implementation of this feature for free tier users has been delayed due to high demand from paying subscribers. The AI model's ability to generate images from text prompts has garnered mixed reactions, with Studio Ghibli's Hayao Miyazaki expressing disdain for AI-powered animation in the past.",
