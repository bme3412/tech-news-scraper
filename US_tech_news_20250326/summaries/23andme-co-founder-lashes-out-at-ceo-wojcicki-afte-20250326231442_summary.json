    "summary": "Linda Avey, co-founder of 23andMe, expressed frustration about the company's bankruptcy filing and lack of oversight from the board, particularly criticizing former CEO Anne Wojcicki. Avey highlighted that the company lost its way without continuous product development and governance, missing an opportunity for personalized health advancement. Despite Wojcicki's attempts to take the company private, all proposals were rejected. The Chapter 11 plan will involve seeking bids for the company, with Wojcicki planning to bid independently. The company struggled with generating revenue, developing therapeutics, and addressing privacy concerns in recent years.",
