    "summary": "President Donald Trump stated that Tesla CEO Elon Musk did not advise on auto tariffs to avoid a conflict of interest. Musk, a senior advisor to Trump, did not comment on the tariffs which Trump mentioned applying to cars not made in the U.S. Trump showcased Tesla vehicles at the White House in admiration of Musk's work but did not receive input from Musk on the tariffs' impact on Tesla's business. Tesla expressed concerns about certain parts not being available domestically, despite efforts to localize its supply chain. The new tariffs could potentially affect Tesla's business, along with other automakers facing increased competition in the electric vehicle market. Domestic automakers' shares, including Tesla's, declined slightly in response to the tariff announcement.",
