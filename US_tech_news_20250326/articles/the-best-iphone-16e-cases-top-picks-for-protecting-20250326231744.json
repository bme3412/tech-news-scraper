Learn more As noted in our iPhone 16e review, it's wise to protect Apple's latest budget phone with a high-quality case. Not even the best iPhone is impervious to accidental damage, and the aluminum edges and glass back of the iPhone 16e offer no exception. Coupled with a screen protector, a case remains the most cost-effective way to avoid the hassle of warranty repairs or the significant cost of replacing a phone outright. See our guide to the best iPhone 16e screen protectors for top options. Also, if you intend to use the iPhone 16e with magnetic accessories, you'll need a case with a built-in magnetic array, as the phone notably lacks Apple's MagSafe technology. As with any of the best phones, it's important to consider cases that will provide adequate protection and functionality for your daily use of the iPhone 16e. Start by considering the level of protection that best compliments your life circumstances. Rugged cases with raised edges and shock-resistant materials are ideal for heavy-duty use or those prone to drops. In contrast, slim cases with moderate protection may be better suited to those looking for a lighter, less bulky option. It's also worth ensuring that the case you choose will not interfere with features you want to use, such as Qi wireless charging. While the iPhone 16e lacks MagSafe, cases with integrated magnets can make the phone compatible with magnetic accessories and magnetic wireless chargers. However, the phone will wirelessly charge at slower speeds (around 7.5W) relative to the flagship iPhone 16 series and most recent iPhones, which feature the MagSafe charging standard (up to 25W). A case meant for the iPhone 16 will not fit the iPhone 16e, and vice versa, due to differences in their designs and dimensions. While the two phones share the same width and depth, the iPhone 16e is slightly shorter than the iPhone 16, has a distinct single-camera system, and lacks the flagship phone's Camera Control button. See our guide to the best iPhone 16 cases to protect the flagship phone, and read our full iPhone 16 review or iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 16 guide for a comprehensive comparison of the models.
