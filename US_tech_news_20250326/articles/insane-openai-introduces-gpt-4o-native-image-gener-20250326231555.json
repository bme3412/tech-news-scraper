Learn More We’re coming up on the one year anniversary since OpenAI released its first “omni” or multimodal model, GPT-4o back in May 2024, but that old standby still has some tricks up its sleeve. Case-in-point, today OpenAI finally turned on the native multimodal image generation capabilities of GPT-4o for users of its hit chatbot ChatGPT on the Plus, Pro, Team, and Free usage tiers. The company said it would also soon be made available for Enterprise, Edu, and through its application programming interface (API). Unlike the previous generative AI image model available in ChatGPT — OpenAI’s DALL-E 3, a classic diffusion transformer model that was trained to reconstruct images from text prompts by removing noise from pixels — this new image generator is part of the same model that spits out text and code, as OpenAI trained the entire model to understand all these forms of media at once. As a result, it is is much more accurate at interpreting a user’s prompts and matching corresponding imagery, the imagery is far more detailed and lifelike, and the user can go and back forth and request specific edits and changes in natural language that the model quickly implements in new generations. This has resulted in a much higher quality image generator that produces far more lifelike images and accurate text baked in, and it’s already impressing users — one of whom calls the quality “insane.” OpenAI president Greg Brockman had long ago previewed this native capability of GPT-4o back in May 2024, but for reasons that still remain unknown publicly, the company held onto it until now — following the public release of what many AI power users saw as a similar feature from Google AI Studio with its Gemini 2 Flash Experimental model. By the same token (pun intended), OpenAI still hasn’t said precisely what data GPT-4o’s image generation capabilities were trained on — and given the history of the company and other model providers, it likely includes many artworks scraped from the web, some of which are presumably copyrighted, which is likely to anger the artists behind them. OpenAI has long aimed to make image generation a core capability of its AI models. With GPT-4o, users can now generate images directly in ChatGPT, refining them through conversation and adjusting details on the fly. The model also integrates into Sora, OpenAI’s video-generation platform, further expanding multimodal capabilities. In an announcement on X, OpenAI confirmed that GPT-4o’s image generation is designed to: Users can describe an image in ChatGPT, specifying details such as aspect ratio, color schemes (hex codes), or transparency, and GPT-4o will generate it within a minute. As independent AI consultant Allie K. Miller wrote on X, it’s a “Huge leap in text generation,” and is “the best” AI image generation model she’s seen. GPT-4o is designed to make image generation not just visually stunning but also practical. Some of the key applications include: According to OpenAI’s official thread on X, GPT-4o introduces several improvements over previous models: Despite its advancements, GPT-4o still has some known challenges: OpenAI is actively addressing these issues through ongoing model refinements. As part of OpenAI’s commitment to responsible AI development, all GPT-4o-generated images include C2PA metadata, allowing users to verify their AI origin. Moreover, OpenAI has built an internal search tool to help detect AI-generated images. Strict safeguards are in place to block harmful content and prevent misuse, such as prohibiting explicit, deceptive, or harmful imagery. OpenAI also ensures that images featuring real people are subject to heightened restrictions. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the release as a “new high-water mark for creative freedom”, emphasizing that users will be able to create a wide range of visuals, with OpenAI observing and refining its approach based on real-world usage. As AI-generated images become more precise and accessible, GPT-4o represents a significant step forward in making text-to-image generation a mainstream tool for communication, creativity, and productivity.
