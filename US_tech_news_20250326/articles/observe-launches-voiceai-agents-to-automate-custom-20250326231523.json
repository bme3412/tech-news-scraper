Learn More Observe.AI has officially launched VoiceAI agents, a solution designed to automate routine customer interactions in contact centers. The latest addition to the company’s AI-driven conversational intelligence platform, VoiceAI agents aim to improve customer experience while reducing operational costs. With this release, Observe.AI is positioning itself as the only complete AI-powered platform that supports enterprises across the entire customer journey. The company’s suite of solutions now includes enterprise-grade VoiceAI agents, real-time agent assist tools, AutoQA for quality monitoring, agent coaching, and business insights. Observe.AI’s VoiceAI agents are built to handle a wide range of customer service inquiries, from frequently asked questions to more complex, multi-step conversations. They are built atop a combination of in-house AI models and partnerships with major AI providers like OpenAI and Anthropic for large language models (LLMs). “It’s an ensemble of multiple smaller models,” Jain explained. “For example, we have a specific model for number detection, a specific model for entity detection, a model for turn detection, and so on.” The goal is to alleviate the burden on human agents, allowing them to focus on higher-value interactions. As Swapnil Jain, CEO and co-founder of Observe.AI, told VentureBeat in a recent video call interview: “Enterprises are saying, ‘Do we really need human agents for these kinds of use cases?’” Jain said that companies often receive calls for basic tasks like checking an account balance or resetting a password—interactions that AI can now handle efficiently. For customers, this means eliminating long hold times and avoiding frustrating IVR menus that require pressing multiple buttons or repeatedly requesting a human agent. The voice AI space is becoming increasingly crowded with options ranging from proprietary models like OpenAI’s newly released GPT-4o-transcribe family and ElevenLabs to open source solutions as well. So why would someone pick Observe.AI’s agents over these? In a nutshell: specialization and ease-of-use. Instead of having to use raw voice AI models through providers’ APIs and building custom integrations with a business, or custom voice apps, Obseve.AI’s platform is already built to essentially “plug and play” with existing workflows and operations. So while, GPT-4o and other LLMs provide raw AI capabilities, Jain and Observe.AI’s contention is that they don’t offer a fully integrated solution for customer service workflows. In addition, unlike traditional voice AI assistants, Observe.AI’s VoiceAI agents are specifically designed for contact centers. The system combines various AI technologies, including: Jain noted that one of the key challenges AI agents face is knowing when a customer has actually finished speaking. “When do you know that the AI agent can start processing and the customer has stopped speaking?” he asked. “Sometimes I’m taking pauses because my sentence is over and I’m starting a new one. Sometimes I just stop speaking. How do you know the difference?” Observe.AI has developed custom in-house models that solve these nuances, ensuring smoother conversations between AI and customers. One of Observe.AI’s key advantages is its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise systems. Over time, the company has developed pre-built integrations with more than 250 platforms, including leading telephony, CRM, and workforce management tools such as Salesforce, Zendesk, and ServiceNow. This approach allows businesses to implement VoiceAI agents quickly. While AI deployments can sometimes take months, Observe.AI claims that its VoiceAI agents can go live in as little as one week, with minimal setup costs. “It’s not a professional services model where we take six months to customize something for you,” Jain said. “We come in, take two weeks to configure the product, and it works.” Given the sensitivity of customer interactions, Observe.AI has built its solution with enterprise-grade security. The company holds certifications including GDPR, HIPAA, HITRUST, SOC2, and ISO27001. While voice biometrics have been used in the past for authentication, Jain stated that Observe.AI does not rely on them due to security concerns. Instead, the system follows traditional authentication methods, such as verifying Social Security numbers or account details. Additionally, Observe.AI offers data redaction capabilities to remove personally identifiable information (PII) before storage, and customers can opt for private instances to ensure data remains isolated. “In today’s world, you cannot rely on individual speech patterns for authentication,” Jain said. “We work with businesses to configure the same security rules they use for their human agents into our AI agents.” Observe.AI’s pricing model is based on completed tasks rather than per-minute usage. The cost depends on the complexity of the interaction, with simpler tasks (such as routing a call) priced lower than more involved tasks (such as processing an insurance claim). According to Jain, businesses can expect to save between 70-80% on customer service costs compared to using human agents. Companies using VoiceAI agents are already seeing significant improvements. Emmanual Noyola, Director of Patient Services at Affordable Care, highlighted the impact on his team: “Beth, our VoiceAI agent, handles multiple intents with a 95% containment rate so our customer care team can focus on more complex cases.” By analyzing every conversation, Observe.AI’s platform continuously refines AI agent performance, ensuring accuracy and compliance. Businesses can also use AutoQA to evaluate both AI and human agents, identifying areas for improvement. One of the key challenges in AI-driven customer service is maintaining accuracy while preventing unintended responses. Jain acknowledged these concerns, referencing past AI missteps in customer service automation. “The core thesis behind making these enterprise-grade is having a very high bar on the confidence of the response,” he said. “If our response confidence is less than a certain threshold, it’s better for the AI agent to not even engage.” The launch of VoiceAI agents marks a major step toward what Observe.AI envisions as the autonomous contact center of the future. As AI continues to evolve, the company is focused on creating solutions that blend automation with human expertise, ensuring a seamless customer experience. “Since our founding seven years ago, we have created a platform that uniquely understands contact center conversations,” Jain said. “It is a logical next step to introduce our VoiceAI agents to automate interactions and ultimately support both human and AI agents in delivering consistent, secure, high-quality customer experience across every touchpoint.” If you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
