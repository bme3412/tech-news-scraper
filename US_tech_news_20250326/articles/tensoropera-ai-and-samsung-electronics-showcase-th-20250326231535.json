    "content": "PALO ALTO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–March 26, 2025– TensorOpera AI and Samsung Electronics announced a pioneering collaboration, which was showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in Las Vegas, demonstrating the immense potential of deploying multi-modal generative AI applications directly on mobile devices powered by Samsung Exynos processors. This milestone marks a significant step forward in redefining the role of mobile technology in advancing artificial intelligence. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250318795401/en/ Bringing generative AI to mobile phones is a transformative innovation that addresses critical challenges such as privacy, personalization, and cost. Smartphones, which store vast amounts of personal data, offer an untapped opportunity to create AI agents uniquely tailored to enhance productivity, communication, and social interactions. With over 80 apps installed on the average smartphone-spanning self-care, productivity, financial planning, and more-the possibilities for personalized AI applications are endless. Imagine a future where your phone acts as a personal creativity coach, helping you brainstorm innovative ideas, sketch designs, compose music, or generate stunning visual art-all tailored to your unique style and preferences, while safeguarding your privacy. Picture a financial advisor that not only optimizes investments but continuously tracks market trends, predicts opportunities, and customizes strategies to align seamlessly with your goals. Envision a writing assistant that adapts to your voice, integrates effortlessly across your apps, drafts emails, creates presentations, and generates compelling content-all personalized to you. This is the transformative potential of bringing multimodal generative AI directly to mobile devices. TensorOpera implements Android applications and highly optimized C++ multi-modal inference pipeline to import and release the Apps on top of Exynos AI Stack. These Apps completely run on any smartphones equipped with Exynos processors with a reasonable inference latency. “Our collaborative demonstration at CES 2025 showcases how advanced multi-modal generative AI applications can seamlessly integrate into mobile devices, paving the way for smarter, more personalized AI solutions that respect user privacy-powered by Samsung’s Exynos mobile chips,” said Dr. Kee-Bong Song, SVP and Head of S.LSI US R&D Center at Samsung Electronics. TensorOpera AI: Pioneering Hybrid Edge-Cloud AI Development TensorOpera AI’s end-to-end platform enables developers to design and deploy AI applications across cloud, mobile, and hybrid mobile-cloud environments. The future of generative AI lies in hybrid edge-cloud deployments, which combine the strengths of on-device processing with the scalability of cloud infrastructure. This hybrid approach balances efficiency and personalization. By processing sensitive data locally on mobile devices, users retain control over their privacy while accessing the immense computational power of the cloud when necessary. This ensures cost-effective deployment, minimizes reliance on centralized cloud infrastructures, and enhances scalability for adoption across industries and geographies. The benefits of hybrid mobile-cloud architectures extend far beyond individual devices. By reducing dependency on expensive cloud GPUs, this distributed model democratizes AI, making advanced models accessible to a broader range of users and developers. This innovation aligns with industry predictions that the market for AI assistants could surpass $6 trillion, with hybrid architectures forming the foundation of next-generation AI ecosystems. “Our collaboration with Samsung Electronics demonstrates the future of AI: smarter, more secure, and deeply personalized solutions powered by the synergy of mobile and cloud technologies,” said Salman Avestimehr, Chairman of TensorOpera AI. “As generative AI continues to evolve, we see hybrid deployments as the key to unlocking its full potential for users worldwide.” Building on their success with Samsung’s on-device multi-modal GenAI project, the founders of TensorOpera have once again demonstrated their prowess in Mobile AI through the ChainOpera AI Terminal App. They have developed LLM-based AI Agent Networks that seamlessly integrate cloud, edge, and device capabilities, serving over a million users at a cost 10 times lower than industry standard, and state-of-the-art LLM performance with a federated AI approach.
